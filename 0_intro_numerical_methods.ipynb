    " - Comprehensive standard library\n",
    " - Well-established 3rd-party packages (NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, etc.)\n",
    " - Easily wraps existing legacy code in C, C++ and Fortran\n",
    " - Python mastery is marketable\n",
    " - Scalability\n",
    "   - Interactive experimentation\n",
    "   - Code can be one-line scripts or million-line projects\n",
